## How to it all works!!
see the Pygame library is used to develop games (if you are reading you must know that) and it is pretty obvious that it games have music ùÑû. And because they have music there must be some way to play it ü•Å. So, Pygame has the mixer class that can be accessed by 

```python
from pygame import mixer
```
now the mixer class has the functions for Playing music, Pausing Music, Unpausing music and resetting the music. 

hope you like it
